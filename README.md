# GitHub x The Society of Women Engineers

## Prerequisites!
* GitHub account signed up: https://github.com/
* GitHub Desktop installed and set up: https://github.com/apps/desktop
* A code editor installed on your PC (preferably, VS Code)


## creating your first repo!
1. Click "Create New Repository"
2. Name it: `swe-match`. _Heads Up!_ Make sure your repo does not share the same name as your username
3. If you want, change the `repo visibility` to private (by default, this is public)
4. Select   `Add README`
5. Hit `Create repository`

You just created your very first repo over GitHub i.e., remote. Now, how do we make it available locally?

## forks
forking is the act of creating a personal copy of someone else's repository on YOUR GitHub account. For the purpose of understanding, you can fork this repo.
1. Navigate to the public repo you wish to fork
2. Click on the `fork` button at the top-right corner
3. GitHub will now create a fork of the original repo in your account. <br> Notice how the link changed from `github.com/simar-rekhi/github_workshop1` to `github.com/your-username/github-workshop`
4. Now this is your independent copy to experiment with!
5. If you wish to work on it locally, follow the procedure listed below under `clone` to clone YOUR fork
